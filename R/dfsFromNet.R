#' Convert igraph or graphNEL networks to list networks
#'
#' This function takes objects of class "igraph" or "graphNEL" (or a list
#' of these objects), and converts them into a networks represented as lists
#' of data frames.
#'
#' @param networks Objects of class "igraph" or "graphNEL". Can be a single
#'     object or list.
#' @return Returns a list of two dataframes, named "vertices", and "edges". "vertices"
#'     will contain as first column "node" with the node names, additional
#'     columns will be used for further node attributes. The edges data frame
#'     contains as first two columns "source" and "target", and will contain
#'     further columns for edge attributes. Return will be a list of lists
#'     if multiple networks have been provided as input.
